                <h4>The ICComics Assembly Line</h4>
                <p>Think of this website as the story board, assembly line, and behind the scenes creation process that comics go through before being minted into fully readable comics. Comics first start with a very bare bones idea, plot and art style</p>
                <h4>Community Voting</h4>
                <p>The community then uses DSCVR Polls to vote on actions and sequences. Slowly building the comic and getting it ready for production.</p>
                <h4>Comics drop in cycles</h4>
                <p>Comics will drop in cycles. At this time im thinking 2 - 3 months but could be longer or less depends on how quickly we can produce, compile and mint these comics.</p>
                <p>‍</p>

                <h4>Guest Artists</h4>
                <p>Once we start reaching the end of the cycle I will begin sourcing Guest artists to come and create their own versions of comics meant to drop that cycle. This artists will be given full creative and creative reign on how they produce their own iteration of a comic. However the only thing that must remain slightly intact is the plot we initially created.</p>
                <h4>Opening the door to artists</h4>
                <p>Lets face it artists are undervalued. Im hoping this give artists an opportunity to show case their skill, their work, their style and give back to the community as well. Artists will be adding to the lore of the ICComics Multiverse. Initially i will be paying artistis up front but eventually we will switch to net profit rewards.</p>
                <h4>Comic iterations examples</h4>
                <p>Think of these comics on this site as blueprints or more specifically a seed for all other comic iterations. The current comics have terrible art lets face it but by using community artists we open the door to infinite creativity and possibility. Imagine the same comic but in an anime style or in an LA noir style or in a 1920s mafia style. its all possible and collectable.</p>

                <h4>Community Creation and Rewards</h4>
                <p>After an iteration of a comic is finished either the character dies, or some other event causes the comic to end prematurely that comic will then go through a community creation phase.</p>
                <h4>The Multiverse becomes your canvas</h4>
                <p>Remember you are a omniverse god. The idea at this moment is that random community users will be chosen to create their own visual version of the current ICComic iteration. The scenes have to remain the same but everything else is interchangeable. The way Bob looks, the flow of the comic, the characters they will all be redrawn however you wish. Quality doesn&#x27;t matter. You have in a sense created another universe within the multiverse.</p>
                <h4>Omniverse Gods should be rewarded for Creation</h4>
                <p>If you get chosen to recreate an ICComic iteration you will be rewarded with a percentage of the profits from the total sales. At this time we dont have but im trying to make it so as many people as possible participate. In a sense you will be paid for your contributions, you are a multiverse artist, an architect.</p>
                <h4>The Omniverse is Infinite!</h4>
                <p>This adds a layer of value to the comic, it adds variability, uniqueness, community involvement and investment. With a multiverse variability is key.</p>

                <h4>Coded NFT Comics</h4>
                <p>Comics are minted in an interactive page flip style with interactive video&#x27;s, animations, advertisements etc. Some comics will be coded by color and will drop randomly to buyers. Those who receive these color coded tokens/NFT&#x27;s will take a direct role in the creation and direction of the next comics that drop.</p>
                <h4>Color Coded Examples</h4>
                <p><strong>Comics with a purple cover - Chosen to become a community artist</strong></p>
                <p>     These Comics will give the holder the opportunity to draw the next iteration style, They basically get a sure spot in drawing a Bob comic variation and earning rewards</p>
                <p><strong>Comics with a Blue token - Drop a message to a Character</strong></p>
                <p>    These Comic holders will be able to reach within the ICComics Multiverse and send a character a message affecting their decision directly</p>
                <p><strong>Comics with a Red token - Force Path</strong></p>
                <p>    These comic holders will be able to recall and forcefully integrate a scene, NFT, location or character that was previously used in the ICComics Omniverse.</p>
                <p><strong>Comics with a Yellow token - Insider Information</strong></p>
                <p>    These Comic holders will gain access to a secret portal where they can see high level story plots or design elements ahead of time. They can share or use this information as they wish. They will see which community artists will be chosen and get sneak peaks into the artists interations.</p>
                <p><strong>Comics with a Orange token - Marketing and Advertisements</strong></p>
                <p>These Comic holders will be able to add advertisements to the comics Ad pages or sell these to marketers, companies or whomever to have their Ads listed in one of the designated ad pages.</p>
