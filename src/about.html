            <div class="text-block">Welcome the first Community Driven Web Comic on the Internet Computer.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="text-block">Both on the Internet Computer and on the IC Comics Multiverse. :)</div>

                <h2>Comic Mechanics (alpha)</h2>
                <p>The IC Comics Multiverse is meant to be a collaborative project with the Internet Computer community. The comics should have either sequenced events, actions, plots or concepts that are decided upon by the community. These inputs will be spliced into the comic creating an organically evolving story line. The characters in the IC Comics Multiverse are subject to chance, meaning all actions taken are based on some sort of modifier or randomly generated number. </p>
                <p>‍</p>
                <h3>Randomly generated Story lines</h3>
                <p>At this time every interaction in the IC Comics Multiverse is decided by a dice roll, attached modifiers and a resist roll if necessary. I will not be providing more information on how this works exactly to the community at this time (further discussion is needed). However the comics do run on an incredibly simplified version of DnD mechanics.</p>
                <p>There will be specific segments in the story line where the community will be able to get involved and vote on outcomes. The frequency and depth of community involvement is held back at the moment to specific sequences until we define some key elements regarding participation. For example</p>
                <ol start="1" role="list">
                  <li>Should the Community only decide on specific actions or cuts in the story line or should they be able to completely over ride the infrastructure?</li>
                  <li>Should the community be involved in the art, conceptualization of the world, on the items and lore behind the world and how much involvement?</li>
                  <li>How should Community Involvement be awarded, should there be awards given, how open of a project should this be?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>‍</p>
                <h4>Remember this is all chance based. Characters can die. However...</h4>
                <h5>It is a multiverse.</h5>
                <ul role="list">
                  <li>Meaning if a character dies. It immediately spawns a new iteration of that character.</li>
                  <li>New skills, stats, and personality type will be generated and a new world map will be drawn up again. </li>
                  <li>This opens up the opportunity for infinite variations of the same character, infinite story lines. How long can you favorite iteration survive. </li>
                  <li>Its all probability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have any suggestions, ideas, want to collaborate or you think this concept is stupid. feel free to let me know by sending me a message using the home page message form.</p>
                <p>* Yes I know the art is shitty. However it was an intentional choice. It makes drawing the procedural comics quicker... who am I kidding, i can&#x27;t draw.</p>
                <blockquote><em>Remember this is all for our collective amusement, its a fun experiment, lets see where it leads.</em></blockquote>

                  <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/simplifying-dd/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/2012/08/simplifying-dd/</a>
                </h4>
                <p>‍</p>
                <p>The linked website will do a much better job of explaining the actual bare bones DnD mechanics then I ever could.</p>
                <h5>Here is a high level overview of things that may not be covered by the link.</h5>
                <p>‍</p>
                <h4>Dice Rolls? RNG?</h4>
                <p>I will be rolling physical dice just because I like to roll physical dice. The rolls will then be used to dictate the outcome of the scene, action or event.</p>
                <p>Once I roll the dice I will notate the numbers in small text before the associated illustration within the comic so viewers are aware of the RNG behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>At this time community users will just have to trust that I am not fudging the numbers up. Just like you would trust a Dungeon master to be fair with his rolls behind his screen I hope the community can trust me with my rolls behind the monitor. :)</p>
                <p>* In the future I would like for rolls to happen on chain, maybe have a community average play out on chain. Depends on what is programmable.</p>
                <h4>Actions Events</h4>
                <p>Every action within the comic will be rolled for using RNG Mechanics here are some examples of actions:</p>
                <p>        Examples:</p>
                <ol start="" role="list">
                  <li>&gt;Bob tries to pick up a heavy rock which means he must roll with his strength against a static number based on the difficulty of the task</li>
                </ol>
                <ol start="" role="list">
                  <li>         (Bob Dice Roll + Strenght Mod vs Static Number= Fail or Pass) </li>
                </ol>
                <ol start="" role="list">
                  <li>‍</li>
                  <li>&gt;Bob tries to hit a Troll on the head with his sword</li>
                  <li>         (Bob Hit Roll + Dex Mod Vs Troll Resist roll + Dex Mod) -&gt; if pass -&gt; Bob rolls for damage.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Fight or Action Sequences</h4>
                <p>To keep momentum flowing in fights the voting polls will happen as quickly as is allowed. Meaning the DSCVR polls will be set to the minimum amount of time delay possible. </p>
                <p>Currently that is about 1 day of voting time</p>
                <p>Fights will have an ebb and flow to them meaning the community will vote for Bobs fight action - &gt; Then initiative will be rolled -&gt; then Bob or the NPC will take their turn and then a new poll will immediately go up with with a 1 day voting delay (the minimum allowed).</p>
                <p>I will try to draw out the comics as quickly as my personal life allows.</p>
                <h4>Character Builds and NPC Builds</h4>
                <h5>Bob</h5>
                <p>Every new iteration of Bob will begin with a vote to allocate stats - by averaging the votes we will then assign stats to Dexterity, Strength and Intelligence with 2,1, or 0. Bob will level up as he defeats enemies.</p>
                <h5>NPC&#x27;s</h5>
                <p>NPC&#x27;s will have stats generated based upon physical traits, meaning some characters will have obvious indictors of strength or weakness. However it is best to be wary for not all characters will have immediate or obvious visual cues of their level.</p>
                <h4>Remember this is all chance based. Characters can die.</h4>

                <h4>DSCVR Voting Polls</h4>
                <p>Voting Polls will open up for specific actions, events, or decisions that Bob must accomplish. The highest voted option will dictate what happens within the comic universe. However there will always be an option for a community generated action therefore opening the door to infinite possibilities. </p>
                <p>Voting Polls will also be used to decide upon character builds, locations, and the actions of other characters within the multiverse... hint. hint.</p>
                <h4>Community Labels</h4>
                <p>Every action within the comic will be rolled for using RNG Mechanics here are some examples of actions:</p>

                  <li>         (Bob Hit Roll + Dex Mod Vs Troll Resist roll + Dex Mod) -&gt; if pass -&gt; Bob rolls for damage.</li>
