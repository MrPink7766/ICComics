        <h2>Comic Mechanics (alpha)</h2>
        <p>The IC Comics Multiverse is meant to be a collaborative project with the Internet Computer community. The comics should have either sequenced events, actions, plots or concepts that are decided upon by the community. These inputs will be spliced into the comic creating an organically evolving story line. The characters in the IC Comics Multiverse are subject to chance, meaning all actions taken are based on some sort of modifier or randomly generated number. </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3>Randomly generated Story lines</h3>
        <p>At this time every interaction in the IC Comics Multiverse is decided by a dice roll, attached modifiers and a resist roll if necessary. I will not be providing more information on how this works exactly to the community at this time (further discussion is needed). However the comics do run on an incredibly simplified version of DnD mechanics.</p>
        <p>There will be specific segments in the story line where the community will be able to get involved and vote on outcomes. The frequency and depth of community involvement is held back at the moment to specific sequences until we define some key elements regarding participation. For example</p>
        <ol start="1" role="list">
          <li>Should the Community only decide on specific actions or cuts in the story line or should they be able to completely over ride the infrastructure?</li>
          <li>Should the community be involved in the art, conceptualization of the world, on the items and lore behind the world and how much involvement?</li>
          <li>How should Community Involvement be awarded, should there be awards given, how open of a project should this be?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h4>Remember this is all chance based. Characters can die. However...</h4>
        <h5>It is a multiverse.</h5>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Meaning if a character dies. It immediately spawns a new iteration of that character.</li>
          <li>New skills, stats, and personality type will be generated and a new world map will be drawn up again. </li>
          <li>This opens up the opportunity for infinite variations of the same character, infinite story lines. How long can you favorite iteration survive. </li>
          <li>Its all probability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have any suggestions, ideas, want to collaborate or you think this concept is stupid. feel free to let me know by sending me a message using the home page message form.</p>
        <p>* Yes I know the art is shitty. However it was an intentional choice. It makes drawing the procedural comics quicker... who am I kidding, i can&#x27;t draw.</p>
