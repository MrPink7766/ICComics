                <h4>Layered Functional NFTs</h4>
                <p>I am a firm believer in decentralization, empowerment of the community and of the individual through ownership and governance. With this concept in mind I plan on releasing NFT&#x27;s with as much functionality for the user or holder as possible. Here I will outline some ideas for building IC Comics NFT&#x27;s for maximum participation and eventually full decentralization of the comic book industry. The NFTs will be broken in layers of functionality for the user. Lets start of with some slow ideas before we fully release.</p>
                <h4>NFT Standard</h4>
                <p>At this point in time I have not put to much though into what standard or format these NFT&#x27;s should follow. I was hoping to be able to run afull HTML file of the comic fully featured with flippable pages, clickable links, images, and NFT&#x27;s with in the comic itself. Is this possible. I sure as hell hope so.</p>
                <p>If you guys know of a good NFT programmer who could pull this off let me know  I would love to work something out. I just submitted a request to Entrepot as well but I don&#x27;t know how long it will take for them to respond.</p>
                <h4>Community Interaction with NFTs</h4>
                <p>If you click on the tabs above you will see more details on each layer of value and interaction that I hope my NFT&#x27;s will provide to the community.</p>

                <h3>Interactive Comics</h3>
                <p>IC Comics should be fully interactive and branch away from real world comics as much as is possible. They should allow for users to interact with the comic, flip the pages, click on NFT&#x27;s, Click on media within the comic, Click on characters, Jump to stat pages, Jump to map pages, Etc</p>
                <h4>Need Developer!!!</h4>
                <p>I don&#x27;t know how to code at all but this is the first step to get these comics moving if you know someone who has the capacity and knowledge to help please message me!!!</p>
                <h4>Future interaction</h4>
                <p>Hopefully in the future with can include crazier interactions withing the comic, NFT games, NFT RNG counters, NFTs that affect next generation seed comics, etc.</p>

                <h4>Community Creation and Rewards</h4>
                <p>Ok here is where the funs starts.</p>
                <p>After an iteration of a comic is finished either the character dies, or some other event causes the comic to end prematurely that comic will then go through a community creation phase.</p>
                <h4>The Multiverse becomes your easel</h4>
                <p>Remember you are a omniverse god. The idea at this moment is that random community users will be chosen to create their own visual version of the current ICComic iteration. The scenes have to remain the same but everything else is interchangeable. The way Bob looks, the flow of the comic, the characters they will all be redrawn however you wish. Quality doesn&#x27;t matter. You have in a sense created another universe within the multiverse.</p>
                <h4>Omniverse Gods should be rewarded for Creation</h4>
                <p>If you get chosen to recreate an ICComic iteration you will be rewarded with a percentage of the profits from the total sales. At this time we dont have but im trying to make it so as many people as possible participate. In a sense you will be paid for your contributions, you are a multiverse artist, an architect.</p>
                <h4>The Omniverse is Infinite!</h4>
                <p>This adds a layer of value to the comic, it adds variability, uniqueness, community involvement and investment. With a multiverse variability is key.</p>
                <p>‍</p>

                <h4>Guest Artists</h4>
                <p>But wait there&#x27;s more.</p>
                <p>When this NFT releases I will be hiring guest artists to render some high quality versions of the IC Comics Issues. These comic iterations will be finite in amount and will have a smaller chance of being minted. Artists will be paid upfront or they can also be paid through profit sharing.</p>
                <h4>Opening the door to artists</h4>
                <p>Lets face it artists are undervalued. Im hoping this give artists an opportunity to show case their skill, their work, their style and give back to the community as well.</p>
                <h4>Comic iterations examples</h4>
                <p>Think of these comics on this site as blueprints or more specifically a seed for all other comic iterations. The current comics have terrible art lets face it but by using community artists we open the door to infinite creativity and possibility. Imagine the same comic but in an anime style or in an LA noir style or in a 1920s mafia style. its all possible and collectable.</p>

                <h4>Coded Comics?</h4>
                <p>Wait what. Yeah there&#x27;s more.</p>
                <p>Coded Comics. No this doesnt mean they will have secret codes or puzzles to solve. actually that might be a cool idea</p>
                <p>It means certain ICComics minted will be coded with a symbol, color or something to signify what type and level of interaction that NFT holder is allotted to him. </p>
                <h4>Color Coded Examples</h4>
                <p><strong>Comic with a purple cover</strong></p>
                <p>     These Comics will give the holder the opportunity to draw the next iteration style, They basically get a sure spot in drawing a Bob comic variation and earning rewards</p>
                <p><strong>Comic with a Blue Cover</strong></p>
                <p>    These Comic holders will be able to reach within the ICComics Multiverse and send a character a message affecting their decision directly</p>
                <p><strong>Comic with a Red Cover</strong></p>
                <p>    These comic holders will be able to recall and forcefully integrate a scene, NFT, location or character that was previously used in the ICComics Omniverse.</p>
                <p><strong>Comic with a Yellow cover</strong></p>
                <p>    These Comic holders will gain access to a secret portal where they can see high level story plots or design elements ahead of time. They can share or use this information as they wish.</p>

                <p>If you click on the tabs above you will see more details on each layer of value that I hope my NFT&#x27;s provide to the community.</p>
